## Host it yourself
If you'd like to have your own bot and use this bot's code, you'd need to have the following:

- Python >=3.8
- [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/)
- An API key from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). Type `/help` in its chat to learn how to do that.
- A minimal server that will run the Python program.

NOTE: Copy the API key and save it to a text file named `api_key.txt`. 

You're good to go üëç
