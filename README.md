# Clip Fetcher Bot

A Telegram bot for downloading videos from popular websites like YouTube, Instagram, Reddit, Facebook etc. This bot uses the popular `yt-dlp` program
in the back end.

## Access
You can access the bot [here](https://t.me/clip_fetcher_bot).

## Features

- Download videos directly within Telegram chat windows from almost all popular websites. A complete list of all supported sites can be found [here](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md).

- Get the link to download the video in case you do not want to download now
for whatever reason. **Do note that YouTube video download links expire after
some time**.


## Usage

You can interact with the bot either personally (i.e. in a seperate chat with the bot) or in a group. If you're using the bot in a group and you've got **multiple bots** in the group, you need to suffix every command with `@clip_fetcher_bot`‚Äîthe username of the bot; you don't need to do this if the last bot that the group members have interacted with is this bot itself.

For futher help, including the various commands the bot supports, type `/help` or `/help@clip_fetcher_bot` (depending on where you're chatting with the bot).

## Host it yourself
If you'd like to have your own bot and use this bot's code, you'd need to have the following:

- Python >=3.8
- [`python-telegram-bot`](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/)
- An API key from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). Type `/help` in its chat to learn how to do that.
- A minimal server that will run the Python program.
- [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

NOTE: Copy the API key and save it to a text file named `api_key.txt`. 

You're good to go üëç
